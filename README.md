A Hardhat-based template for developing Solidity smart contracts, with sensible defaults.

## Token Contract Specifications

The smart contract implements ERC20 functionality with the following additional features:

### Transaction Limits and Fees

- Configurable transaction size limit of 1% of total supply
- Configurable wallet size limit of 1% of total supply
- 5% fee on buy/sell transactions (transactions involving liquidity pools)

### Fee Distribution

- 2% of fees added to {TOKEN}/ETH Uniswap v2 pair (LP tokens sent to configurable wallet)
- 3% of fees converted to ETH and sent to configurable revenue wallet
- Fee amounts and splits are configurable

### Security Features

- Blacklisting capability to block known sniper bots
- Pausable token transfers (except for owner during initial liquidity setup)
- Configurable fee and limit exemptions for specific accounts

## Getting Started

Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/paulrberg/hardhat-template/generate) button at the top of the page to
create a new repository with this repo as the initial state.

## Features

This template builds upon the frameworks and libraries mentioned above, so for details about their specific features,
please consult their respective documentations.

For example, for Hardhat, you can refer to the [Hardhat Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) and the
[Hardhat Docs](https://hardhat.org/docs). You might be in particular interested in reading the
[Testing Contracts](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts) section.

### Sensible Defaults

This template comes with sensible default configurations in the following files:

```text
├── .editorconfig
├── .eslintignore
├── .eslintrc.yml
├── .gitignore
├── .prettierignore
├── .prettierrc.yml
├── .solcover.js
├── .solhint.json
└── hardhat.config.ts
```

### VSCode Integration

This template is IDE agnostic, but for the best user experience, you may want to use it in VSCode alongside Nomic
Foundation's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull
request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must use your `INFURA_API_KEY` and your `MNEMONIC` as GitHub secrets.

For more information on how to set up GitHub secrets, check out the
[docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

First, you need to install the dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Then, you need to set up all the required
[Hardhat Configuration Variables](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/configuration-variables). You might
also want to install some that are optional.

To assist with the setup process, run `bunx hardhat vars setup`. To set a particular value, such as a BIP-39 mnemonic
variable, execute this:

```sh
bunx hardhat vars set MNEMONIC
? Enter value: ‣ here is where your twelve words mnemonic should be put my friend
```

If you do not already have a mnemonic, you can generate one using this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
bun run typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
bun run test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
bun run lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
bun run lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
bun run coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
REPORT_GAS=true bun run test
```
